**Introduction.** The planning, design, and construction of the built environment is on the verge of a fundamental transformation. A key element of this transformation is a radical shift in paradigm from planning and design representations of unconnected data to practices with an overwhelming amount of information-rich data. Artificial Intelligence (AI), in particular Machine Learning (ML), provides planners, designers, and constructors with new models and methods to engage in these data-heavy processes in order to synthesize meaningful information for all areas of their practice from planning to design to fabrication to erection. This course provides the College of Design, Construction and Planning (DCP) students an opportunity to learn about application of AI in their disciplines.
